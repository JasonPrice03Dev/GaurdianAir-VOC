# 🌬️ GaurdianAir – VOC Detector for Raspberry Pi 5

GaurdianAir is a smart **Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) detector** using the **Raspberry Pi 5**, **SenseHat**, and **MQ-135 sensor**.
It monitors air quality in real-time and visualizes data through interactive graphs on a sleek dashboard powered by **Flask**.

---

## 📌 Overview
  GaurdianAir empowers users to track air quality efficiently, helping identify harmful organic compounds.
  Designed for Raspberry Pi 5 with SenseHat, it uses sensor data processed with RTIMULib to provide accurate readings.
  The Flask dashboard displays the data live, making it easy to monitor and analyze VOC levels.

# 🔒 Security Notice
  ⚠️ **Important:**  
  Sensitive files such as the Firebase **ServiceAccountKey** are **NOT** included in this repository and should **never** be shared publicly.  
  Users must obtain their own keys and configure them locally to keep the project secure.

---

# ❌ Problems
  Due to the Raspberry Pi 5’s security limitations with Firebase, direct use of Firebase libraries was unreliable.
  To mitigate this, the application runs inside a **Python virtual environment** to isolate dependencies and improve stability.  
  Additionally, the project uses **LGPIO** instead of the default **RPi.GPIO** library because of compatibility and performance issues on the Pi 5.

# 🔍 RTIMU
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'RTIMU' - this may appear as I could not push the RTIMU files to GitHub as it is in itself a GIT repository.
  This will need to be installed to run the code also.
